2. Define two variables and assign them a numerical value. Shows the maximum value between the two without using a temporary variable.

4. Define an array of numbers and write code to display the maximum value.
5. Define a structure called Computer that defines the brand, processor name, and memory size of a computer:
    - Write an associated (static) function called new that creates an instance of the structure.
    - Write a method called display that prints all the information.
6. Define an array with elements of type Computer. Write a program that displays a menu with the following options:
